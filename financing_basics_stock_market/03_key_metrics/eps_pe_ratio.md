# Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

## Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Earnings per share (EPS) is a financial metric that indicates the profitability of a company on a per-share basis. It is calculated by dividing the net income of the company by the number of outstanding shares. EPS is a crucial indicator for investors as it provides insight into a company's profitability and is often used to compare the performance of companies within the same industry.

### Formula:
EPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares

## Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share. It is used by investors to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings. A high P/E ratio may indicate that the market expects future growth, while a low P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is undervalued or that the company is experiencing difficulties.

### Formula:
P/E Ratio = Market Price per Share / Earnings per Share

## Significance

Both EPS and the P/E ratio are essential tools for investors:

- **EPS** helps investors gauge a company's profitability and performance over time.
- **P/E Ratio** provides a quick way to evaluate a company's valuation compared to its earnings, helping investors make informed decisions about buying or selling stocks.

Understanding these metrics is vital for making sound investment choices and assessing the financial health of a company.
