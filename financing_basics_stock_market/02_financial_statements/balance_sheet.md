# Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time. It is divided into three main components: assets, liabilities, and equity.

## Components of a Balance Sheet

### Assets
Assets are resources owned by the company that have economic value. They are typically classified into two categories:

1. **Current Assets**: These are assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year. Examples include:
   - Cash and cash equivalents
   - Accounts receivable
   - Inventory
   - Prepaid expenses

2. **Non-Current Assets**: These are long-term investments that are not expected to be converted into cash within one year. Examples include:
   - Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)
   - Intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks)
   - Long-term investments

### Liabilities
Liabilities are obligations that the company owes to external parties. They are also classified into two categories:

1. **Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that are due within one year. Examples include:
   - Accounts payable
   - Short-term debt
   - Accrued expenses

2. **Non-Current Liabilities**: These are obligations that are due beyond one year. Examples include:
   - Long-term debt
   - Deferred tax liabilities
   - Pension obligations

### Equity
Equity represents the residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting liabilities. It is often referred to as shareholders' equity and includes:

- Common stock
- Preferred stock
- Retained earnings
- Additional paid-in capital

## Importance of the Balance Sheet
The balance sheet is a crucial tool for stakeholders, including investors, creditors, and management, as it provides insights into the company's financial stability, liquidity, and capital structure. It helps assess the company's ability to meet its short-term and long-term obligations and evaluate its overall financial health.
